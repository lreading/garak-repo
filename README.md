# Garak Report Dashboard

A Next.js dashboard for visualizing and analyzing Garak security testing reports.

## Getting Started

### Environment Setup

1. Copy the example environment file:
   ```bash
   cp example.env .env
   ```

2. Configure the `REPORT_DIR` environment variable in your `.env` file:
   ```bash
   # Directory where Garak report files are stored
   REPORT_DIR=./data
   ```

   **Path handling:**
   - **Relative paths** (like `./data`, `../reports`) are resolved from the project root
   - **Absolute paths** (starting with `/`) are used as-is

### Running the Application

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Environment Variables

The following environment variables can be configured:

### `REPORT_DIR`
- **Description**: Directory where Garak report files are stored
- **Default**: `./data`
- **Examples**: 
  - `REPORT_DIR=./data` (relative to project root)
  - `REPORT_DIR=/var/log/garak/reports` (absolute path)
- **Path handling**: 
  - Relative paths are resolved from the project root
  - Absolute paths (starting with `/`) are used as-is

## Usage

1. Place your Garak report files (`.jsonl` format) in the directory specified by `REPORT_DIR`
2. The dashboard will automatically detect and list available reports
3. Select a report to view detailed analysis including vulnerability categories, attempt results, and statistics

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
