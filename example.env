# Environment variables for Garak Report Dashboard

# Directory where Garak report files are stored
# Default: ./data (relative to project root)
REPORT_DIR=./data

# Path handling:
# - Relative paths (like ./data, ../reports) are resolved from the project root
# - Absolute paths (starting with /) are used as-is
#
# Example configurations:
# REPORT_DIR=./data                    # Relative to project root
# REPORT_DIR=../reports                # Parent directory of project
# REPORT_DIR=/home/user/garak-reports  # Absolute path
# REPORT_DIR=/var/log/garak/reports    # System directory
