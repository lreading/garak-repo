# Environment variables for Garak Report Dashboard

# Directory where Garak report files are stored
# Default: ./data (relative to project root)
REPORT_DIR=./data

# Path handling with security validation:
# - Relative paths (like ./data) are resolved from the project root
# - Absolute paths are allowed but validated for security
# - All paths are checked to prevent directory traversal attacks
#
# Example configurations:
# REPORT_DIR=./data                    # Relative to project root
# REPORT_DIR=./reports                 # Subdirectory of project root
# REPORT_DIR=../reports                # Parent directory of project
# REPORT_DIR=/home/user/garak-reports  # Absolute path
# REPORT_DIR=/var/log/garak/reports    # System directory

# Security Configuration
# Set to 'production' to enable strict security controls
NODE_ENV=development

# Optional: Custom security settings
# SECURITY_STRICT_MODE=true           # Enable additional security checks
# SECURITY_LOG_LEVEL=warn             # Log level for security events
